it would all be gone . . . or at least , he would be gone from it. his breath came slow and deep , and his mouth and throat were completely dry , but so were his eyes . &gt ; dumbledore ’ s betrayal was almost nothing. of course there had been a bigger plan : harry had simply been too foolish to see it , he realized that now . the thing is that harry does see the sense of it. he understands why dumbledore did what he did , and he understands why he is the one who has to die , and if it is him , then nobody else has to. at this point , harry 's emotions are a huge mess. he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not , so anger is not at the forefront of his brain. eventually when he meets dumbledore , after being 'killed ' by voldemort , the shock has worn off , but he is still mostly confused , which keeps him from feeling anger. it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead. then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry , with tears in his eyes , which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did , he did n't do for the funsies. he made these decisions because they were the best ones , but they were n't easy or kind , not even on dumbledore himself , which is what helps harry come to peace with them . honestly , the books go way more in depth with harry 's feelings re : dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post , so i very much urge you to read them. it will help clarify a lot . b. when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past , it actually bothers him a lot. there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father 's behaviour. he does quite a dangerous thing ( using umbridge 's fire to talk to sirius and lupin ) just to get more information on his father 's behaviour. eventually he learns to give it a place. he still loves his father , obviously , but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism. still , from all accounts , it does seem like james * honestly * changed , and snape was n't exactly innocent in all of it either ( james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other ) so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either. he 's a person who made douchy choices as a teen ( but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life ) who eventually grew out of it , which is sort of how harry comes to remember him . c. in the order of the phoenix , after christmas , sirius gives harry one of a pair of two-way mirrors but does n't explain them. they are basically like mirror walkie-talkies , that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention. harry , realising it is a way to contact sirius , fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk. he forgets about them , even when he needs them most. after sirius 's death , harry remembers the mirror , however because sirius is dead , he can not use them anymore. still , he does n't get rid of it. it eventually shatters , but harry keeps the biggest piece. the second mirror , the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius 's house for stuff to sell. he sells that mirror to aberforth ( dumbledore 's brother ) who realises what is. aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry ( it is his blue eye harry sees ) and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger . d. snape loved lily. snape has never loved anyone but lily. lily cared great for him , as a friend ( and potentially more according to jkr ) but the path snape put himself on , the one with the dark arts , turned her away from him. it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood. lily ended their friendship there , but snape did n't stop loving her. because he loved her , he tried to ask voldemort to spare her ( and through that , gave lily an out , which she refused to take but instead protected her son ) . knowing that snape loved lily so much , dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side. when dumbledore asks if snape 's feeling are still the same after all this time , snape casts that patronus ( lily 's patronus had been a doe as well ) and tell him , yes , always. he 's still in this for lily .\",\n",

3 with $ 19.9 mil for the 4 day total ( $ 17.8 mil for the 3 day ) . while performing only slightly under expectations , this still was not great for stars rebel wilson and especially dakota johnson who last year dominated the same weekend with 50 shades of grey , though clearly people came out more for the source material there than johnson . * the harder hit new entry was * * zoolander 2 * * which opened at #

       " \"i do n't think the sorting hat puts you in the house you 're best suited to but rather what you aspire to be. on your points : 1 ) on potter more about the sorting hat it says that peter pettigrew narrowly escaped slytherin when the hat was in him so maybe he asked to be put in gryffindor ? not unlike harry ? i would argue though that despite being cowardly which led him to betraying james and lily i do think he had some courage. he stayed with voldemort for a year he could 've easily abandoned him,chopped off his right hand,kill 13 muggles in the middle of the street and risked getting caught but managed to escape,i mean sure they were motivated by cowardice but i would say fear makes you do courageous things and that was what pettigrew did. other traits of gryffindor was being courageous and reckless,not just bravery so again despite being pushed by cowardice and self serving ( slytherin traits ) he still did pretty reckless things. ( i do know that he is definitely not a hufflepuff,not with his actions of treachery.hufflepuffs are n't the leftover house you got ta be loyal unfortunately peter wasnt ) 2 ) i agree with this. percy was ambitious enough to get in good with the ministry,although i do wonder in ootp did percy believe the ministry 's lies or did he know it was all fake but did n't care because he wanted to stay in their good books ? what do you think ? ( at the end of the deathly hallows he ran away from the ministry to join and fight with his family that could be said to be brave and i think so because he was a pureblood at the time he was protected by his status at the ministry and be still went back to his family but at the same time i do n't think it was brave because i think percy was forced to kish away because they would 've been after him to ask about his family and any sane wizard or witch at the time could realize the ministry was at its all time low-voldemort low not fudge and umbridge low ) . 3 ) dumbledore is a tricky one. i always thought that with his master chess game he was playing he would 've been the perfect slytherin.lol i think dumbledore is wayyyyyy more cunning than voldemort or even slughorn. although like in point one i made about pettigrew,the same could be said for dumbledore despite slythering his way through the war he took pretty big risks that relied heavily on chance. that 's pretty gryffindor to me. i think if there was n't a war going on ravenclaw would be his best fit he was a wise old man after all . 4 ) conclusion : i like that the characters were not clean cut caricatures of their houses. they 're human , the world is n't split into black and white every character in the series could be argued to demonstrate qualities of each of the houses. it gives them depth . 5 ) bonus : i think voldemort would 've made a good gryffindor , his actions were even more daring than dumbledore both while he was at school ( chamber of secrets fiasco ) and when he became the official dark lord p.s : its spelled grindelwald\",\n",

unless you live in the middle of nowhere . - this home that snape lives in is the same home he grew up in. why on earth would he stay there ? he has no love for that house at all. he hated his father. he resented his mother. his childhood there was awful. why stay at spinner \\'s end ? for me , it would be like sirius wanting to stay at grimmauld place . - spinners end is located in the town of cokeworth. and it \\'s actually where harry stayed at the hotel when vernon was trying to escape the letters from hagrid in ps - we would later learn that spinners end is near the street where lily and petunia grew up - voldemort does seem to make a big mistake here in punishing draco for the mistakes of lucius. he misjudges the malfoy family. they seem to have very little loyalty to him. they see him as a sure bet. their work for him is all in their own self interest. but the minute when it is n\\'t in their self interest to support him , they disobey. narcissa here was n\\'t supposed to talk about draco \\'s mission to snape. but she does it to protect her son. and i kinda feel like voldemort should understand this. it \\'s a very slytherin trait. to protect yourself first . - does bella really think that snape is on dumbledore \\'s side ? or does this opinion stem from her jealousy of his position in the eyes of the dark lord ? - snape is able to hide his emotions so well. but do you think if voldemort or bellatrix brought up lily , would he be able to conceal his emotions about that ? would he betray himself ? - are snape \\'s parents alive ? what happened to them ? - do you think snape \\'s attitude toward muggles has matured ? because i \\'m just assuming here that a lot of his dislike for them came from his hatred of his father. but that seems like something you can mature out of. as an adult , you can rationalise that muggles and wizards are equally capable of the abuse and neglect that snape was subject to. has snape rationalised that within himself ? or does a lot of that turn around stem from lily ? he did n\\'t seem to understand then that she was muggle born and would be offended by his attitude towards them. does he understand that now as an adult ? - where does the hidden staircase in snape \\'s house lead to ? was that an original part of the house ? - snape being able to boss around wormtail must \\'ve been so fantastic for snape. yeah he \\'s not james or sirius. but he \\'s one of the next best options. and also partially responsible for the death of lily. he has to love bullying him . - would n\\'t wormtail be much more effective at spying on snape if he was in his animagus form ? - it \\'s mentioned a couple of times that snape \\'s attitude towards bellatrix is mocking. he is amused by her. and it kinda makes me think that snape almost enjoys his role as double agent. he likes to be important. he likes the mystery of it. and he enjoys being the smartest one in the room. i think that last one is important. he would n\\'t mock voldemort would he ? but he enjoys hiding the truth from someone he considers lesser like bellatrix . - do you think wormtail was put here by voldemort to spy on severus ? - i know most people seem to love alan rickman \\'s portrayal of snape but one of the gripes i would have with it is that rickman \\'s snape does n\\'t say much. he picks and chooses his words very carefully. but the book snape is much more verbose . - snape catches bella out here. she must either admit that he is on her side or admit that snape has tricked voldemort. it \\'s a lose-lose for her . - snape says that voldemort ordered him to be at hogwarts to spy on dumbledore. was that voldemort \\'s idea ? or was it somehow engineered by dumbledore to give dumbledore and snape and excuse to meet ? because it would suspicious for both to meet otherwise. but makes perfect sense if they both are at hogwarts . - does snape know the real reason why he is denied the dada job ? i presume it \\'s because it \\'s because of the curse on the job. more than dumbledore thinking it would bring about a relapse . - snape says he had 16 years of information to give voldemort about dumbledore. what information did he give ? and how does he hide the vital stuff ? does he consult dumbledore on what he can say and what he can not ? - if voldemort had revealed himself to snape in ps , what changes ? how does snape change his actions to bring down voldemort whilst not appearing to do so ? - snape here confirms that he was the one that voldemort referred to when he said that one of their number had left them forever . - voldemort seems to cultivate this competition between his death eaters to curry his favour. which seems to have both positive and negative consequences. i think a negative one is on display here in that it causes jealousy and infighting between death eaters . - bella says \" the dark lord has , in the past , entrusted me with his most precious \" and cuts herself off. is she referring here to the horcrux hidden in her vault ? - jo has said before that when a secret keeper dies , that all the people that the person told the secret to become secret keepers themselves. so when dumbledore died , should n\\'t snape have been able to reveal the hq of the order to the death eaters ? how did snape explain that away ? - snape says that his information led to the death of emmeline vance. so did dumbledore sacrifice her ? did he tell snape to pass along the information that led to her death ? why did he pick her ? is snape here lying to bella ? maybe he \\'s claiming credit for it when it really had nothing to do with him . - snape is in his element here when he \\'s insulting harry. and i think this is one of the main reasons why voldemort trusts him. he \\'s so sincere with his dislike of harry. he \\'s not putting on any pretence at all . - snape talks about dumbledore \\'s greatest weakness. that he has to see the best in people. now we later learn that dumbledore has a much stronger reason to trust snape than just believing the best of him. now to me , this is a good lie. because it \\'s got a fair bit of truth in it. but it \\'s also something that dumbledore himself is able to manipulate to get the best out of the lie. he can use the idea that voldemort thinks his greatest weakness is his overly trusting nature to misdirect voldemort. to make him think dumbledore is making one move when he is actually making another . - how much did the duel with voldemort take out of dumbledore ? did it affect him at all ? or was snape lying here ? - what does snape tell voldemort about dumbledore \\'s injury ? how does he tell him how it was sustained ? - is narcissa a death eater ? she was n\\'t at the graveyard when voldemort returned. so is she kind \\'ve an associate ? an honorary death eater ? - why is bella and cissy surprised to find out that snape knows of the plan to kill dumbledore ? would n\\'t it make perfect sense ? otherwise snape could unwittingly get in the way of the plan like what happened in ps - does snape actually know the plan here ? or is he just pretending to know to try and gain information about it ? he never says what the plan is before narcissa kinda makes it obvious . - \" if draco succeeds he will be honoured beyond all others \" . draco kinda achieved his goal. he only really failed at the final hurdle. but the end result was the same anyway. so did he get the proper credit from voldemort for it ? lucius still seems to be in the bad books of voldemort in the next book. so it would seem not . - narcissa calls snape the dark lords favourite. is she just sucking up to him ? or does voldemort favour snape most ? and why is snape voldemort \\'s favourite ? does voldemort see himself in snape ? - dumbledore is n\\'t the type to kill an enemy like narcissa is thinking will happen. even his most famous victory ended with him capturing his opponent. and i think maybe she expects dumbledore to behave like voldemort would in a similar situation. voldemort would show no mercy if he discovered a plot to kill him. dumbledore just tries to look out for his would be killer . - snape says that in the unlikely event that draco succeeds at the task that snape was to remain a spy a little while longer. but when dumbledore actually dies , there \\'s pretty much no need for a spy. the order crumbles without dumbledore. they have no leadership. and they have no initiative. it \\'s almost not worth spying on anymore . - bella talks about if she had sons. do you think if she had sons that being a mother would change her ? we see here that narcissa cares more about her son than the dark lord. would bella follow the same route ? or would she be utterly psychotic ? - we get our first ever mention of the unbreakable vow. i \\'m kinda surprised that voldemort would n\\'t make his supporters make the unbreakable vow to be loyal to him. maybe he thinks it \\'s unnecessary . - what happens with an unbreakable vow if there \\'s some grey area involved ? not all cases are black and white . - in court , they should make witnesses swear the unbreakable vow to tell the truth during the court proceedings. yeah it would be a little barbaric. but you \\'d get the truth out of people . - i really think snape could \\'ve gotten out of making the unbreakable vow if he \\'d tried a little harder. he could \\'ve said that his vows to voldemort would supersede his obligation to draco if conflict arose and therefore he could n\\'t make the vow. as it happens , his vow coincides with dumbledore \\'s plan anyway. so no harm was really done . - the unbreakable vow was the subject of much speculation. did he just kill dumbledore to fulfil the vow ? some speculated that snape was on neither side. he was just out for himself. it was a huge gamble though from snape. he called bella \\'s bluff which had to earn him points . * * quotable quote * * well wormtail \\'s here but we \\'re not counting vermin are we ?',\n",

why do n\\'t they kiss more muggles ? particularly since they ca n\\'t see them . - the opposition leader is described as barely concealing his glee about the recent atrocities. and it kinda reminded me why i hate politics . - the painting that connects the ministry of magic and the muggle prime minister. who is that ? was it a real person ? did that person hold high offices in both the muggle and wizarding world ? does that painting person just have to stay as still as possible most of the day ? - how would they be able to make the president of the other country forget to call ? would n\\'t they have to cast the spell on him directly ? do the other ministries of magic from around the world collude to organise meetings for each other ? - is there a code of ethics for casting spells on muggle leaders ? are there certain things you ca n\\'t do ? - i think wizards really do n\\'t understand how arrogant they sound to others. it \\'s a constant complaint about them. from centaurs to goblins to the prime minister here . - do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world ? - when jo originally planned the series , terrorism was n\\'t nearly the issue that it was when this book was published. the world events of the time really give the terrorist actions of the death eaters more emotional weight in the mind of the reader than what would have happened otherwise . - fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil. violation of the gamp law about food . - if you ca n\\'t remove the painting from the wall , why not remove the wall itself ? surely it would be possible. i know there \\'s likely a permanent sticking charm here. but there \\'s ways around that . - how did it take an hour to explain the story of voldemort ? how much information is the muggle prime minister given here ? - under what circumstances is the minister of magic obligated to contact the muggle prime minister ? - it says that they \\'re importing three foreign dragons. now would the common welsh green count as a foreign dragon ? you \\'d think not right ? which kinda suggests that the champions were originally just meant to fight the other three dragons. and presumably the welsh green was the ring in when they needed another to fight harry . - for the muggle prime minister to find out why these terrible things are happening but not be able to tell anyone about it or do anything about it must be frustrating as hell - if the muggles united together with the wizards , do you think they would be able to take voldemort down ? - \" is a man alive if he can not be killed ? \" it \\'s a surprisingly deep philosophical question here from fudge . - we find out that amelia bones has been killed. her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war. what does voldemort have against this family ? why target them ? - we also find out about emmeline vance \\'s murder. the only time we met her previously was as a member of the advance guard in ootp - the most obvious analogy we can make with fudge and scrimgeur is neville chamberlain and winston churchill. fudge is the weaker option who seemingly let voldemort take a foothold again. and scrimgeur is the fighter. a wizard who is seen as tough and fit for war . - fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later. but surely...why would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year ? no one could forgive that . - the quote that i \\'ve selected at the bottom is important. jo talks about this a bit. how magic is n\\'t the solution to problems. you ca n\\'t just wave your wand and make bad things go away. magic is n\\'t the magic bullet . * * quotable quote * * the trouble is , the other side can do magic to , prime minister .',\n",

       " 'i hate to just call it \" the racing movie with chris hemsworth \" but i do n\\'t know how else to describe it in just a few words. it was a very good movie but for some reason it got little widespread attention. the movie did less than 100m at the box office and got zero academy award nominations. i kinda feel sorry for ron howard and all the other people that were involved with it because i think it deserved so much more recognition than what it got . i think the film was pretty excellent in all categories. for those that do n\\'t know , it \\'s based on a true story and follows the rivalry between formula 1 racers niki lauda and james hunt. chris hemsworth played james hunt , who was basically the womanizing daredevil driver , whereas niki lauda was the more cold and calculating type , who looked at everything mathematically and only took risks when needed . lauda was played by daniel bruhl ( you know him as the sniper in inglourious basterds ) and i truly think , without hyperbole , that he is just as good of an actor as christoph waltz or michael fassbender. his career is n\\'t as good but his performance as lauda was oscar worthy , and i think he deserved it more than matthew mcconaughey \\'s performance in dallas buyers club. matt did well do n\\'t get me wrong , but bruhl really became lauda. i remember watching a special feature on the blu-ray where he said he would be on the phone with the real niki lauda before filming , just asking about all the little details to make it as real as possible. and i believe someone even said they played the voiceover narration for a formula 1 fan , and they were unable to tell the difference between him and the real guy . but honestly , [ the whole cast was perfect ] ( -content/uploads/2013/09/8m7vtxe-1024x778.jpg ) . it \\'s actually amazing how they were able to get actors that looked so similar without in any way hurting the quality of the performances because they all knocked it out of the park . it was also extremely well written and directed. the screenplay made all the characters three dimensional and established complex relationships between them. lauda was very cold and a bit of an asshole but still very good at his job and a decent guy underneath. hunt was a self destructive playboy but still likable and had a genuine passion and desire to win. in fact , one of my favorite bits of characterization in probably any movie is when chris hemsworth joins the mile high club and stares at himself in the mirror while he \\'s banging the chick. it really got you inside his head without saying a word. hunt and lauda were rivals but there was still a certain level of respect between them . peter morgan is a great screenwriter and may be my favorite currently working. he had previously worked with ron on frost/nixon. i think it \\'s interesting that both of their collaborations involved the relationships between two men opposing each other . i think that \\'s one reason i liked the movie so much. there was no protagonist. there was not an antagonist either. they were just people. and for that reason i rate it higher than a lot of biopics because so many of them shoehorn in bad guys when real life does n\\'t normally have clear cut bad guys. this level of ambiguity made \" rush \" feel so much more real. i believe howard said he wanted the film to feel like a race where you cheer each guy on at different times , whether or not they \\'re on the track . but as far as the directing , howard made the race track really come alive. everything felt so raw and intense. and it still felt this way off the track ( there \\'s a very raw scene in a hospital which i wo n\\'t spoil , but it \\'s hard to watch ) . but i think the best part of the whole movie , and what made it one of the best experiences i \\'ve ever had in a theater , was the sound. if it deserved an oscar for anything it was the sound. watching the movie on blu-ray is still enjoyable , and makes you feel like you \\'re watching a race track. but when i saw it in theaters , i felt like i was actually on the race track. i \\'m so , so glad i was one of the ( apparently few ) people to see it in theaters because it was an experience that home theaters ca n\\'t match . but i still highly recommend it. it really felt like a classic scorsese film. the characterization of hunt was similar to marty \\'s usual protagonists and it felt as raw as raging bull. i really want scorsese and peter morgan to team up because i think the two would work together well since in some ways he reminds me of paul schrader . i really ca n\\'t recommend \" rush \" more. i definitely think it deserved best picture and it really felt like a modern classic when i saw it. i hope it gets more attention over time because it was pretty much everything i could ever want in a movie .',\n",

please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily  ',\n",

at his door and snape welcomes them in snape bullies wormtail a bit then bellatrix questions snape about whose side he is on he is able to explain away all her questions then narcissa has a chance to air her worry draco has been given a task by the dark lord narcissa thinks he ll die in the attempt she asks snape to do it instead of draco she makes him swear the unbreakable vow to protect draco and carry out the deed should he fail    poi    bellatrix kills a fox here but she does nt say avada kedavra which suggests that it can be used non verbally given the number of times other people use it and say the incantation  you kinda get the impression that it can only be used verbally but this would suggest otherwise   bellatrix says that snape lives in a  muggle dunghill   but considering that hogsmeade is the only fully wizard village in britain  would nt most wizards live in towns predominantly muggle  unless you live in the middle of nowhere   this home that snape lives in is the same home he grew up in why on earth would he stay there  he has no love for that house at all he hated his father he resented his mother his childhood there was awful why stay at spinner s end  for me  it would be like sirius wanting to stay at grimmauld place   spinners end is located in the town of cokeworth and it s actually where harry stayed at the hotel when vernon was trying to escape the letters from hagrid in ps  we would later learn that spinners end is near the street where lily and petunia grew up  voldemort does seem to make a big mistake here in punishing draco for the mistakes of lucius he misjudges the malfoy family they seem to have very little loyalty to him they see him as a sure bet their work for him is all in their own self interest but the minute when it is nt in their self interest to support him  they disobey narcissa here was nt supposed to talk about draco s mission to snape but she does it to protect her son and i kinda feel like voldemort should understand this it s a very slytherin trait to protect yourself first   does bella really think that snape is on dumbledore s side  or does this opinion stem from her jealousy of his position in the eyes of the dark lord   snape is able to hide his emotions so well but do you think if voldemort or bellatrix brought up lily  would he be able to conceal his emotions about that  would he betray himself   are snape s parents alive  what happened to them   do you think snape s attitude toward muggles has matured  because i m just assuming here that a lot of his dislike for them came from his hatred of his father but that seems like something you can mature out of as an adult  you can rationalise that muggles and wizards are equally capable of the abuse and neglect that snape was subject to has snape rationalised that within himself  or does a lot of that turn around stem from lily  he did nt seem to understand then that she was muggle born and would be offended by his attitude towards them does he understand that now as an adult   where does the hidden staircase in snape s house lead to  was that an original part of the house   snape being able to boss around wormtail must ve been so fantastic for snape yeah he s not james or sirius but he s one of the next best options and also partially responsible for the death of lily he has to love bullying him   would nt wormtail be much more effective at spying on snape if he was in his animagus form   it s mentioned a couple of times that snape s attitude towards bellatrix is mocking he is amused by her and it kinda makes me think that snape almost enjoys his role as double agent he likes to be important he likes the mystery of it and he enjoys being the smartest one in the room i think that last one is important he would nt mock voldemort would he  but he enjoys hiding the truth from someone he considers lesser like bellatrix   do you think wormtail was put here by voldemort to spy on severus   i know most people seem to love alan rickman s portrayal of snape but one of the gripes i would have with it is that rickman s snape does nt say much he picks and chooses his words very carefully but the book snape is much more verbose   snape catches bella out here she must either admit that he is on her side or admit that snape has tricked voldemort it s a loselose for her   snape says that voldemort ordered him to be at hogwarts to spy on dumbledore was that voldemort s idea  or was it somehow engineered by dumbledore to give dumbledore and snape and excuse to meet  because it would suspicious for both to meet otherwise but makes perfect sense if they both are at hogwarts   does snape know the real reason why he is denied the dada job  i presume it s because it s because of the curse on the job more than dumbledore thinking it would bring about a relapse   snape says he had 16 years of information to give voldemort about dumbledore what information did he give  and how does he hide the vital stuff  does he consult dumbledore on what he can say and what he can not   if voldemort had revealed himself to snape in ps  what changes  how does snape change his actions to bring down voldemort whilst not appearing to do so   snape here confirms that he was the one that voldemort referred to when he said that one of their number had left them forever   voldemort seems to cultivate this competition between his death eaters to curry his favour which seems to have both positive and negative consequences i think a negative one is on display here in that it causes jealousy and infighting between death eaters   bella says  the dark lord has  in the past  entrusted me with his most precious  and cuts herself off is she referring here to the horcrux hidden in her vault   jo has said before that when a secret keeper dies  that all the people that the person told the secret to become secret keepers themselves so when dumbledore died  should nt snape have been able to reveal the hq of the order to the death eaters  how did snape explain that away   snape says that his information led to the death of emmeline vance so did dumbledore sacrifice her  did he tell snape to pass along the information that led to her death  why did he pick her  is snape here lying to bella  maybe he s claiming credit for it when it really had nothing to do with him   snape is in his element here when he s insulting harry and i think this is one of the main reasons why voldemort trusts him he s so sincere with his dislike of harry he s not putting on any pretence at all   snape talks about dumbledore s greatest weakness that he has to see the best in people now we later learn that dumbledore has a much stronger reason to trust snape than just believing the best of him now to me  this is a good lie because it s got a fair bit of truth in it but it s also something that dumbledore himself is able to manipulate to get the best out of the lie he can use the idea that voldemort thinks his greatest weakness is his overly trusting nature to misdirect voldemort to make him think dumbledore is making one move when he is actually making another   how much did the duel with voldemort take out of dumbledore  did it affect him at all  or was snape lying here   what does snape tell voldemort about dumbledore s injury  how does he tell him how it was sustained   is narcissa a death eater  she was nt at the graveyard when voldemort returned so is she kind ve an associate  an honorary death eater   why is bella and cissy surprised to find out that snape knows of the plan to kill dumbledore  would nt it make perfect sense  otherwise snape could unwittingly get in the way of the plan like what happened in ps  does snape actually know the plan here  or is he just pretending to know to try and gain information about it  he never says what the plan is before narcissa kinda makes it obvious    if draco succeeds he will be honoured beyond all others   draco kinda achieved his goal he only really failed at the final hurdle but the end result was the same anyway so did he get the proper credit from voldemort for it  lucius still seems to be in the bad books of voldemort in the next book so it would seem not   narcissa calls snape the dark lords favourite is she just sucking up to him  or does voldemort favour snape most  and why is snape voldemort s favourite  does voldemort see himself in snape   dumbledore is nt the type to kill an enemy like narcissa is thinking will happen even his most famous victory ended with him capturing his opponent and i think maybe she expects dumbledore to behave like voldemort would in a similar situation voldemort would show no mercy if he discovered a plot to kill him dumbledore just tries to look out for his would be killer   snape says that in the unlikely event that draco succeeds at the task that snape was to remain a spy a little while longer but when dumbledore actually dies  there s pretty much no need for a spy the order crumbles without dumbledore they have no leadership and they have no initiative it s almost not worth spying on anymore   bella talks about if she had sons do you think if she had sons that being a mother would change her  we see here that narcissa cares more about her son than the dark lord would bella follow the same route  or would she be utterly psychotic   we get our first ever mention of the unbreakable vow i m kinda surprised that voldemort would nt make his supporters make the unbreakable vow to be loyal to him maybe he thinks it s unnecessary   what happens with an unbreakable vow if there s some grey area involved  not all cases are black and white   in court  they should make witnesses swear the unbreakable vow to tell the truth during the court proceedings yeah it would be a little barbaric but you d get the truth out of people   i really think snape could ve gotten out of making the unbreakable vow if he d tried a little harder he could ve said that his vows to voldemort would supersede his obligation to draco if conflict arose and therefore he could nt make the vow as it happens  his vow coincides with dumbledore s plan anyway so no harm was really done   the unbreakable vow was the subject of much speculation did he just kill dumbledore to fulfil the vow  some speculated that snape was on neither side he was just out for himself it was a huge gamble though from snape he called bella s bluff which had to earn him points    quotable quote   well wormtail s here but we re not counting vermin are we  ',\n",

arrival of fudge they discuss recent events the muggle prime minister reminisces about previous meetings with fudge fudge then reveals to the prime minister that voldemort is back they talk about sirius black  the bridge collapse  the giant attack in the west country  amelia bones  emmeline vance and the dementors he then reveals that he has been outed as minister of magic he introduces his successor  rufus scrimguer he talks about security for the prime minister  kingsley and the junior minister who is quacking    poi    jo considered including this chapter in chamber of secrets but it ended up being cut and put here   if we were to apply this to the real world  the most likely candidate for who the muggle prime minister is sir john major who was prime minister of the uk from 1990 to 1997 although that does nt really fit with what fudge says about the previous prime minister he refers to him as a male but the prime minister who preceded sir john was margaret thatcher   there s a talk of a bridge collapse here and in the movies they collapse the millennium bridge however  that bridge opened on june 2000 which was after the events of the main narrative of the harry potter novels the bridge that collapsed in the novel is the brockdale bridge   the opposition leader talks about a grim mood gripping the country fudge confirms this later in this chapter that it is caused by the dementors so is there job just to walk around spreading misery for voldemort  why do nt they kiss more muggles  particularly since they ca nt see them   the opposition leader is described as barely concealing his glee about the recent atrocities and it kinda reminded me why i hate politics   the painting that connects the ministry of magic and the muggle prime minister who is that  was it a real person  did that person hold high offices in both the muggle and wizarding world  does that painting person just have to stay as still as possible most of the day   how would they be able to make the president of the other country forget to call  would nt they have to cast the spell on him directly  do the other ministries of magic from around the world collude to organise meetings for each other   is there a code of ethics for casting spells on muggle leaders  are there certain things you ca nt do   i think wizards really do nt understand how arrogant they sound to others it s a constant complaint about them from centaurs to goblins to the prime minister here   do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world   when jo originally planned the series  terrorism was nt nearly the issue that it was when this book was published the world events of the time really give the terrorist actions of the death eaters more emotional weight in the mind of the reader than what would have happened otherwise   fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil violation of the gamp law about food   if you ca nt remove the painting from the wall  why not remove the wall itself  surely it would be possible i know there s likely a permanent sticking charm here but there s ways around that   how did it take an hour to explain the story of voldemort  how much information is the muggle prime minister given here   under what circumstances is the minister of magic obligated to contact the muggle prime minister   it says that they re importing three foreign dragons now would the common welsh green count as a foreign dragon  you d think not right  which kinda suggests that the champions were originally just meant to fight the other three dragons and presumably the welsh green was the ring in when they needed another to fight harry   for the muggle prime minister to find out why these terrible things are happening but not be able to tell anyone about it or do anything about it must be frustrating as hell  if the muggles united together with the wizards  do you think they would be able to take voldemort down    is a man alive if he can not be killed   it s a surprisingly deep philosophical question here from fudge   we find out that amelia bones has been killed her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war what does voldemort have against this family  why target them   we also find out about emmeline vance s murder the only time we met her previously was as a member of the advance guard in ootp  the most obvious analogy we can make with fudge and scrimgeur is neville chamberlain and winston churchill fudge is the weaker option who seemingly let voldemort take a foothold again and scrimgeur is the fighter a wizard who is seen as tough and fit for war   fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later but surelywhy would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year  no one could forgive that   the quote that i ve selected at the bottom is important jo talks about this a bit how magic is nt the solution to problems you ca nt just wave your wand and make bad things go away magic is nt the magic bullet    quotable quote   the trouble is  the other side can do magic to  prime

       " 'i hate to just call it  the racing movie with chris hemsworth  but i do nt know how else to describe it in just a few words it was a very good movie but for some reason it got little widespread attention the movie did less than 100m at the box office and got zero academy award nominations i kinda feel sorry for ron howard and all the other people that were involved with it because i think it deserved so much more recognition than what it got  i think the film was pretty excellent in all categories for those that do nt know  it s based on a true story and follows the rivalry between formula 1 racers niki lauda and james hunt chris hemsworth played james hunt  who was basically the womanizing daredevil driver  whereas niki lauda was the more cold and calculating type  who looked at everything mathematically and only took risks when needed  lauda was played by daniel bruhl  you know him as the sniper in inglourious basterds  and i truly think  without hyperbole  that he is just as good of an actor as christoph waltz or michael fassbender his career is nt as good but his performance as lauda was oscar worthy  and i think he deserved it more than matthew mcconaughey s performance in dallas buyers club matt did well do nt get me wrong  but bruhl really became lauda i remember watching a special feature on the bluray where he said he would be on the phone with the real niki lauda before filming  just asking about all the little details to make it as real as possible and i believe someone even said they played the voiceover narration for a formula 1 fan  and they were unable to tell the difference between him and the real guy  but honestly   the whole cast was perfect      it s actually amazing how they were able to get actors that looked so similar without in any way hurting the quality of the performances because they all knocked it out of the park  it was also extremely well written and directed the screenplay made all the characters three dimensional and established complex relationships between them lauda was very cold and a bit of an asshole but still very good at his job and a decent guy underneath hunt was a self destructive playboy but still likable and had a genuine passion and desire to win in fact  one of my favorite bits of characterization in probably any movie is when chris hemsworth joins the mile high club and stares at himself in the mirror while he s banging the chick it really got you inside his head without saying a word hunt and lauda were rivals but there was still a certain level of respect between them  peter morgan is a great screenwriter and may be my favorite currently working he had previously worked with ron on frostnixon i think it s interesting that both of their collaborations involved the relationships between two men opposing each other  i think that s one reason i liked the movie so much there was no protagonist there was not an antagonist either they were just people and for that reason i rate it higher than a lot of biopics because so many of them shoehorn in bad guys when real life does nt normally have clear cut bad guys this level of ambiguity made  rush  feel so much more real i believe howard said he wanted the film to feel like a race where you cheer each guy on at different times  whether or not they re on the track  but as far as the directing  howard made the race track really come alive everything felt so raw and intense and it still felt this way off the track  there s a very raw scene in a hospital which i wo nt spoil  but it s hard to watch   but i think the best part of the whole movie  and what made it one of the best experiences i ve ever had in a theater  was the sound if it deserved an oscar for anything it was the sound watching the movie on bluray is still enjoyable  and makes you feel like you re watching a race track but when i saw it in theaters  i felt like i was actually on the race track i m so  so glad i was one of the  apparently few  people to see it in theaters because it was an experience that home theaters ca nt match  but i still highly recommend it it really felt like a classic scorsese film the characterization of hunt was similar to marty s usual protagonists and it felt as raw as raging bull i really want scorsese and peter morgan to team up because i think the two would work together well since in some ways he reminds me of paul schrader  i really ca nt recommend  rush  more i definitely think it deserved best picture and it really felt like a modern classic when i saw it i hope it gets more attention over time because it was pretty much everything i could ever want in a movie  ',\n",

      "   all of these questions are answered by the books , and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the mo ies ne er went into if you d rather not ha e any further spoilers , please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long o erarcing thread in the last book through out the book , harry , at many points , feels  ery frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry howe er he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets , it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked , but it was something he needed e entually , harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know e erything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories , he does think about dumbledore s betrayal , but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly ,  ery slowly , he sat up , and as he did so he felt more ali e and more aware of his own li ing body than e er before why had he ne er appreciated what a miracle he was , brain and ner e and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least , he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep , and his mouth and throat were completely dry , but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore ’ s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it , he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did , and he understands why he is the one who has to die , and if it is him , then nobody else has to at this point , harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to li e but knowing he can not , so anger is not at the forefront of his brain e entually when he meets dumbledore , after being killed  by  oldemort , the shock has worn off , but he is still mostly confused , which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry , with tears in his eyes , which helps harry understand that e erything dumbledore did , he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones , but they were nt easy or kind , not e en on dumbledore himself , which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly , the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could e er do in a simple post , so i  ery much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past , it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensi e and his father s beha iour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s beha iour e entually he learns to gi e it a place he still lo es his father , ob iously , but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still , from all accounts , it does seem like james  honestly  changed , and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who e entually grew out of it , which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix , after christmas , sirius gi es harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies , that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry , realising it is a way to contact sirius , fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them , e en when he needs them most after sirius s death , harry remembers the mirror , howe er because sirius is dead , he can not use them anymore still , he does nt get rid of it it e entually shatters , but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror , the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and e entually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape lo ed lily snape has ne er lo ed anyone but lily lily cared great for him , as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on , the one with the dark arts , turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there , but snape did nt stop lo ing her because he lo ed her , he tried to ask  oldemort to spare her  and through that , ga e lily an out , which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape lo ed lily so much , dumbledore used that lo e to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time , snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him , yes , always he s still in this for lily \n",

      "   yeah , that would be really cool i d like to see both skywalker lightsabers in use by luke , and i think a double bladed saber would suit rey a lot better  gt   in a modified  ersion of this , we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will , allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors  meh , i do nt really like the sound of that too much it d just be too i do nt know i guess it d just be a little unnecessary and besides , are nt kyber crystals naturally colored as opposed to being colored by the force  it d also feel kinda wrong seeing anakin s or luke s lightsaber change colors after so many years of them being bluegreen \n",
      "   not sure if already been discussed but  what if we get a scene in ep 8 or e en 9 , where luke is fighting with both his lightsabers   i think that would be insane to see luke do that with the contrasting color lightsabers  and it would be a great call back to anakin doing that  i d like it if rey uses anakin s saber to begin her training , but when she completes her own saber , it is returned to luke  i imagine the climatic battle in ol ing rey with a doublestaff saber and luke using the blue and green  fighting all the remaining knights of ren simultaneously   in a modified  ersion of this , we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will , allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors \n",

      "   i do nt think the sorting hat puts you in the house you re best suited to but rather what you aspire to be on your points  1  on potter more about the sorting hat it says that peter pettigrew narrowly escaped slytherin when the hat was in him so maybe he asked to be put in gryffindor  not unlike harry  i would argue though that despite being cowardly which led him to betraying james and lily i do think he had some courage he stayed with  oldemort for a year he could  e easily abandoned him,chopped off his right hand,kill 13 muggles in the middle of the street and risked getting caught but managed to escape,i mean sure they were moti ated by cowardice but i would say fear makes you do courageous things and that was what pettigrew did other traits of gryffindor was being courageous and reckless,not just bra ery so again despite being pushed by cowardice and self ser ing  slytherin traits  he still did pretty reckless things  i do know that he is definitely not a hufflepuff,not with his actions of treacheryhufflepuffs are nt the lefto er house you got ta be loyal unfortunately peter wasnt  2  i agree with this percy was ambitious enough to get in good with the ministry,although i do wonder in ootp did percy belie e the ministry s lies or did he know it was all fake but did nt care because he wanted to stay in their good books  what do you think   at the end of the deathly hallows he ran away from the ministry to join and fight with his family that could be said to be bra e and i think so because he was a pureblood at the time he was protected by his status at the ministry and be still went back to his family but at the same time i do nt think it was bra e because i think percy was forced to kish away because they would  e been after him to ask about his family and any sane wizard or witch at the time could realize the ministry was at its all time low oldemort low not fudge and umbridge low   3  dumbledore is a tricky one i always thought that with his master chess game he was playing he would  e been the perfect slytherinlol i think dumbledore is wayyyyyy more cunning than  oldemort or e en slughorn although like in point one i made about pettigrew,the same could be said for dumbledore despite slythering his way through the war he took pretty big risks that relied hea ily on chance that s pretty gryffindor to me i think if there was nt a war going on ra enclaw would be his best fit he was a wise old man after all  4  conclusion  i like that the characters were not clean cut caricatures of their houses they re human , the world is nt split into black and white e ery character in the series could be argued to demonstrate qualities of each of the houses it gi es them depth  5  bonus  i think  oldemort would  e made a good gryffindor , his actions were e en more daring than dumbledore both while he was at school  chamber of secrets fiasco  and when he became the official dark lord ps  its spelled grindelwald\n",
      "   dumbledore being in slytherin would be a great twist and excellent way of saying  see , there are good people in slytherin  \n",
      "   i think that when it comes to where the sorting hat places you , it ultimately comes down to who you are aspiring to be in that moment think about when harry was sorted if it had been completely up to the sorting hat , harry would ha e been placed in slytherin just as harry told his son at the end of book 7 , the hat goes with your choice abo e all other aspects it weighs in so whoe er your 11yearold self belie es he or she is or should be , that is where the hat sorts you another good example is the sorting hat s placement of malfoy i lo e how it is demonstrated in the mo ie  the hat barely touches malfoy s head and he is immediately sent to slytherin this is because he has been raised by a family bursting with pureblood and slytherin pride , and this is who he aspires to be as well  i hope this make sense  but in the end , i really belie e that the sorting hat does nt choose the house for you  you choose the house for you \n",
      "   seems like the sorting hat has a pretty clear algorithm  1  you a dick  yes → slytherin , no → 2  you bra e  yes → gryffindor , no → 3  you smart  yes → ra enclaw , no → hufflepuff  case studies  malfoy dick  yup does nt matter that he s smart  he fixed the  anishing cabinet , props for that   hermione dick  nope bra e  yup does nt matter that she s brilliant , she gets gryffindor   harry dick  apparently enough to confuse the hat , but borderline bra e  alright , gryffindor  counterpoints  cedric seems not a dick , bra e and smart , which would put him in gryffindor  so to answer your question , cedric ob ious algorithm malfunction \n",
